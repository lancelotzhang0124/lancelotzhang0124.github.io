# About Me

<img src="https://lancelotzhang0124.github.io/Lingfeng.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360">

Here is **Lingfeng Zhang (张凌风)**.<br>

I am a graduate student majoring in **Psychiatry and Mental Health** at Renmin Hospital, **Wuhan University**, supervised by **[Prof. Zhongchun Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W1uFFUAAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Clinical Medicine from the **Xiangya School of Medicine**, **Central South University**.<br> 

My research focuses on identifying potential biomarkers in psychiatric disorders through **scRNA-seq** and **multi-omics integration**.<br>

> *&ensp;Psychiatric disorders impose a substantial and growing burden on global health, accounting for significant disability, socioeconomic impact, and healthcare costs. Despite their prevalence and severity, current diagnostic frameworks rely heavily on subjective symptom reports, and objective biomarkers remain elusive.
> <br> &ensp;Recent breakthroughs in technologies like scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics are transforming the way we study the brain. These tools allow us to examine the human brain at single-cell resolution, revealing its complex cellular architecture in unprecedented detail. Such advances offer exciting opportunities for psychiatry: by creating brain atlases tailored to specific disorders and populations, we may finally begin to identify reliable biomarkers and clarify the biological roots of mental illness.
> <br> &ensp;Therefore, brain atlases generated using these new approaches can deepen our intuitive understanding of psychiatric disorders. When combined with methods such as machine learning, they may help uncover shared biological alterations underlying similar psychiatric symptoms across different conditions. This process not only facilitates the discovery of potential biomarkers but also offers a clearer explanation of how genetic and environmental factors interact within individual cells.*


- My current research focuses on single-cell transcriptomics and multi-omics integration in psychiatric disorders. My research interest lies in identifying potential biomarkers for psychiatric disorders through multi-omics data analysis. In a word, multi-omics approaches, particularly scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, are essential tools for exploring the pathological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. I wish to devote my abilities to this meaningful field to help address psychiatric disorders.

- Moving forward, I plan to integrate multi-omics data across disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. By performing cross-disease and cross-region scRNA-seq, I aim to build a clinically anchored scRNA-seq cohort to uncover shared cellular changes underlying common psychiatric symptoms. In parallel, I will apply cutting-edge spatial technologies like Visium HD and CODEX to further refine brain atlases of mental illness. Through this work, I hope to advance a multi-layered understanding of psychiatric disorders—from the genome to the proteome—and contribute to the discovery of potential biomarkers.
