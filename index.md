# About Me

<img src="https://lancelotzhang0124.github.io/Lingfeng.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Lingfeng Zhang (张凌风)**.<br>

I am a graduate student majoring in **Psychiatry and Mental Health** at Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, supervised by [Prof. Zhongchun Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W1uFFUAAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Clinical Medicine from the Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University. My research focuses on identifying potential biomarkers in psychiatric disorders through single-cell transcriptomics and multi-omics integration.

## Research Interests

- scRNA-seq
- scATAC-seq
- Spatial Transcriptomics
- proteomics
- post-GWAS

My current research focuses on single-cell transcriptomics and multi-omics integration in psychiatric disorders. My research interest lies in identifying potential biomarkers for psychiatric disorders through multi-omics data analysis. In a word, multi-omics approaches, particularly scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, are essential tools for exploring the pathological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. I wish to devote my abilities to this meaningful field to help address psychiatric disorders.
